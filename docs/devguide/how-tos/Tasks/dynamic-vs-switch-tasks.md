# Dynamic vs Switch Tasks

Dynamic Tasks are useful in situations when need to run a task of which the task type is determined at runtime instead
of during the configuration. It is similar to the `SWITCH` use case but with `DYNAMIC`
we won't need to preconfigure all case options in the workflow definition itself. Instead, we can mark the task
as `DYNAMIC` and determine which underlying task does it run during the workflow execution itself.

* Use DYNAMIC task as a replacement for SWITCH if you have too many case options
* DYNAMIC task is an option when you want to programmatically determine the next task to run instead of using expressions
* DYNAMIC task simplifies the workflow execution UI view which will now only show the selected task
* SWITCH task visualization is helpful as a documentation - showing you all options that the workflow could have
   taken
* SWITCH task comes with a default task option which can be useful in some use cases
