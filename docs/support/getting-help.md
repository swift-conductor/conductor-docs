# Getting Help

This is an open source project, so the amount of time we have available to help resolve your issue is often 
limited as all help is provided on a volunteer basis. 

If you are experiencing problems using Swift Conductor then please post about your problem in 
the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/swift-conductor/conductor/discussions) first. 
This allows other users to help with your problem. 

If indeed a bug has been identified in the Swift Conductor software, then document the problem in the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/swift-conductor/conductor/issues). 

Please refrain from immediately opening an issue unless you are certain itâ€™s a problem in the Swift Conductor software.
